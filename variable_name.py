# I wanna define a new variable to hold greetings i.e "Welcome"

#Anisa
n1 = "Welcome"

#Misby
greetings = "Welcome"

#Omer
o1 = "Welcome"


# I wanna define what date my kid was born

#Anisa
june = "June"
# Would that be descriptive enough? june = "April"

#Misby
birthday = "June"

#Omer
birthday1 = "June"

# Another example would be as follows
month_of_birth = "June"


# I wanna define how much is the cost of the bread in dollars i.e. 2

# Anisa

# Misby
price_bread = 2

# Omer
